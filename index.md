These are my musings from **#ChennaiFOSS2024**, I had a great time there learning about new FOSS technologies and how one can contribute or atleast being a part of it and spread awareness. So thought of sharing my learnings from each of the talks attended there. 
## [Ansh  Arora]()
The session was started by Ansh on how's and what's of foss and also @FOSSUnited as a foundation (its mission and goals). Also in terms of stats he showed how @FOSSUnited in a small span of time achieved lot in spread of open source culture.
Ansh  also mentioned Eric S Raymond's  Cathedral and Bazar (Book on opensource culture). 
He explained the cathedral and bazar models in coherence with opensource culture and what Linus law was : *Given enough eyeballs , bugs become shallow*

Sarukaa talked about how [@fr8ian](https://x.com/fr8ian) was able to rebuild their architechure using FOSS products.She mentioned about the struggle they were having but instead of buying ,building through FOSS helped [@fr8ian](https://x.com/fr8ian) optimise better.


## [Sai Poruri Rahul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulporuri/) 

Poruri Sai Rahul spoke about Software Patents
I really liked this talk very much due to the novelty but also the importance of the topic that was discussed.
Rahul illustrated how the patents with broad definition can be used by the companies to gain a leverage over other companies and thus their should be hard regulatory measures in place before the providance of software patents or they mustn't be provided.

## [Shree Kumar]() 
Shree kumar spoke about THEJAS32 a processor which in commonplace terms he mentioned as sarkari SOC because of its non-usability in bigger picture. But according to him if this device which is cheap (Rs. 289) is utilised for learning purpose as it would have a great impact on the hardware opensource community.

He is also working on a personal project which would enhance it further.
