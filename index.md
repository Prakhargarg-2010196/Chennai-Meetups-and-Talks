These are my musings from **#ChennaiFOSS2024**, I had a great time there learning about new FOSS technologies and how one can contribute or atleast being a part of it and spread awareness. So thought of sharing my learnings from each of the talks attended there. 

## [Ansh  Arora](https://www.ansharora.tech/)

The session was started by Ansh on how's and what's of foss and also @FOSSUnited as a foundation (its mission and goals). Also in terms of stats he showed how @FOSSUnited in a small span of time achieved lot in spread of open source culture.
Ansh  also mentioned Eric S Raymond's  Cathedral and Bazar (Book on opensource culture). <br>
He explained the cathedral and bazar models in coherence with opensource culture and Linus Law.

Sarukaa talked about how [@fr8ian](https://x.com/fr8ian) was able to rebuild their architechure using FOSS products.She mentioned about the struggle they were having but instead of buying ,building through FOSS helped [@fr8ian](https://x.com/fr8ian) optimise better.

> Rahul spoke about **Software Patents** <br>

I really liked this talk very much not only due to my novelty but also the importance of the topic that was discussed.
Rahul illustrated how the patents with broad definition can be used by the companies to gain a leverage over other companies and thus their should be hard regulatory measures in place before the providance of software patents or they mustn't be provided.

Shree kumar spoke about THEJAS32 a processor which in commonplace terms he mentioned as sarkari SOC because of its non-usability in bigger picture. But according to him if this device which is quite cheap (**Rs. 289**) is utilised for learning purpose,it would have a great impact on the hardware open-source community.

## [Sundara Raman Narayanan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundara-raman-narayanan-7821a77/)
Sundara talked about the advantages of using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) over [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

He also informed about the FOSS alteratives of Pandas which help induce the same functionality without much need to change in the code too.
Two such FOSS alternatives are :
- [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin)
- [Polars](https://pola.rs/)

Question I asked:
Why DuckDB when other FOSS alteratives for data processing like [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) exists.
Answer :
Duck DB does it all locally and requires less memory which is not possible in case of hadoop.

# OCAML workshop
## [Sudha Parimala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudha247/) and [Kaustubh M](https://kaustubh.page/)
![IMG_8947](https://github.com/Prakhargarg-2010196/FOSS_CHENNAI/assets/77922738/919ec3ef-5565-4480-8d82-735693488cf8)

In this workshop guided by **Sudha** she utilised a small library called [Ocaml-Joy](https://github.com/Sudha247/ocaml-joy) to break to us the magical powers of the language ocaml 
in creative coding. 
She utilised the functions present in the language to do the following tasks
- Draw shapes
- Rotations and translation of shapes
- Repeatitions of shapes

She also showed a example that is great for motivation as to what can be achieved through this library.

# Sonali Srivastava
### Know Your Hard: Automate image security scan with Kyverno & Trivy

![IMG_20240406_142651](https://github.com/Prakhargarg-2010196/FOSS_CHENNAI/assets/77922738/ee0a9755-6359-42ab-b83d-b92442e21769)

Sonali explained the importance of security for images in kubernetes clusters and how creating policies give us granular access control over the images in the cluster.
<br>
Sonali illustrated these using a hello world program with one signed image and another unsigned one.
She showed every step from creation of policy using [**Kyverno**](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/) to signing the images by use of [**Cosign**](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) and then verifying the access control in the end by testing the access of signed vs unsigned images.

She also used a tool called **[trivy](https://trivy.dev/)** to scan the images for security vulnerabilities.


# Balu Babu
### Building Open Hardware with FOSS
![IMG_8981](https://github.com/Prakhargarg-2010196/FOSS_CHENNAI/assets/77922738/98da7cae-c257-465e-92b2-6358b0b04ef2)

Well this was an interesting talk. This included everything from enthusiasm towards tech and also the creativity for building things.
<br>
He started the talk by explaining how its so easy to start simple things and build simple things using hardware by just understanding the foundations.
Balu was so keen to showing how he solved the problem of custom key-bindings by creating the entirely open-source [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/)-compatible 3x3 mechanical macropad which is easily configurable if you are able to code in C-programming. 
He delved entirely while showing how he basically design the boards, create [PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) for them using [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) and then 3-D prints them. 
He also shared the process of slicing using [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/) which done before 3-D printing the board.

# Vignesh 
### Protecting digital rights and privacy using free software
 ![IMG_8989](https://github.com/Prakhargarg-2010196/FOSS_CHENNAI/assets/77922738/52e7d56e-f3e6-4907-9447-9acb6272e844)

 
 Vignesh spoke about the privacy concerns we face in today's world in usage of free softwares. He also raised his concern on the topic that many apps can be free but not open-source so one should be aware about what tools one uses as they might hamper their privacy to a great level.
 Vignesh also conveyed some tools that can be utilised in your workflow such **UBlock origin** and also other opensource apps like **NewPipe**.
